Are you calling because you were injured, or are you a medical professional, insurance provider, attorney, or calling about something else?\nUSER: Something else.\nAGENT: Okay, thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me exactly why you’re calling today?\nUSER: I'm looking for a public accommodations discrimination attorney.\nAGENT: Thank you for sharing that. Just to make sure I get all the details, what’s your name?\nUSER: Juan, j u a n, Hernandez, h e r n a n d e z.\nAGENT: Thank you, Juan Hernandez. What’s the best phone number to reach you? Please say it slowly so I can write \nUSER: Crinkle.\nAGENT: it down and repeat it back to you.\nUSER: Sure. Three \nAGENT: Hmm, I \nUSER: four seven.\nAGENT: didn’t \nUSER: Three four seven six four zero\nUSER: eighty five thirty four.\nAGENT: Thank you. So your phone number is three four seven - six four zero - eight five three four. Is that correct?\nUSER: That is correct. Yes.\nAGENT: Perfect, thank you for confirming. What made you reach out to CourtLaw today about public accommodations discrimination? Can you tell me a little more about your situation?\nUSER: My situation, is the store frequent?\nUSER: have a policy of some sometimes they have they have a limit on items. That could be purchased for the day. Customer.\nUSER: What happened to me, I've never seen them due to anyone else or I think they did to anybody else that day.\nUSER: So I purchased the item, but they have a policy that as long as you come in with family or friends or whoever else that you're with, those people can get an item as well. Let's say, limit is one per day, Ten of us, we can get ten of the item. So I purchased for the day, left, came back, returned with my family, and there was an employee inside who I made eye contact with while they were I actually inside to let my family know it's gonna be on the outside of the store just so they they would not think that I was trying to re return and put and double dip. So I I made eye contact with one of the employees and inside from the outside of the store, and that person alerted, I guess, like, higher up manager And after the purchase, my family made, we were inside of we were inside of this market place at the store. It's one of those, uh, marketplaces, uh, plazas that has a lot of multiple stores in it.\nUSER: And some person just ran up on us, and started basically insinuating that I was paying people to buy me product and which wasn't the case, and I explained that this was my family.\nUSER: And at the at that time, they let it go.\nUSER: And this never happened every week with the store all the time.\nUSER: But that particular person that I make eye contact with initially, also, when I come into that store, it's just this just doesn't happen. It happened the very next day as well.\nUSER: Like, it's always nudging that other person who has more authority to, like, kind of work. And to me, for some reason, I don't know why.\nUSER: Which is uncomfortable and what they really what they did was embarrass me in front of my family.\nUSER: And they they did apologize and all of that, but I don't think it was correct. I think I felt discriminated\nAGENT: Thank you for sharing all of that, Juan. I’m really sorry you had to go through that. Just so I can make sure the attorney has all the details, can you tell me the name and \nUSER: Yes. \nAGENT: location of the store where this happened?\nUSER: The store is, uh, is Fandai, b a n d a I It's it's located inside of it's located at Mitsua. Plaza.\nUSER: In Edgewater, New Jersey.\nAGENT: Thank you, Juan. So, just to confirm, the store is Bandai, spelled B A N D A I, inside Mitsua Plaza in Edgewater, New \nUSER: Yes. \nAGENT: Jersey. Is that all correct?\nUSER: That is correct. That is correct. Yes.\nUSER: they do have a policy that like I said, any piece that has many people as you come with, you can purchase. For for the group. Right? So and and I've never seen them do that to anybody else, and ever ever.\nUSER: And the \nAGENT: Thank you for \nUSER: next day, I returned, and I've I've been sent yes. The next day, I returned, and I never I didn't say anything. I've I've returned to purchase more. And the the that person did the same thing against knowledge. I I wear glasses off me. So I'm wearing my shades and you're in front of me, she's doing it, like, she nudged the other person again, the person who who confronted us the previous night. And that person kinda felt bad. She had apologized as said, oh, no. No. That was her that was his family. Last night. This and that. And then they were all apologetic and stuff. And but it's like, like, if they have cameras, it's fair. Like, you can see it. You know. It's very obvious.\nUSER: So that took \nAGENT: I \nUSER: place, and I did return to this. Yep.\nUSER: So that that's it. That's pretty much it.\nAGENT: Thank you for explaining everything, Juan. Just a couple more questions so I can \nUSER: Yeah.\nAGENT: make sure the attorney has all the details.\n\nWhat date did this first happen? If you’re not sure of the exact date, do you remember about what day of the week it was?\nUSER: I will tell you It happened just one second. It happened\nAGENT: Take \nUSER: Friday Sprite.\nAGENT: your time, Juan. Whenever you’re ready, just \nUSER: And how can and I wanna make wanna be sure. One second. Let me just look at my calendar. It happened on Friday, I believe that was the eleventh or something.\nAGENT: Thank you for checking, Juan. Today \nUSER: Correct.

Any other details or concerns?\nUSER: Oh, No. Just that.\nUSER: I mean, I mean, like I said, the day when I returned, they were very, very apologetic.
